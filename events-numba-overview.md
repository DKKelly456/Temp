# Events Numba Overview

## What is Numba?

Numba is an open-source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. It's particularly useful for numerical and array-oriented computing.

## Key Features

1. **JIT Compilation**: Numba compiles Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime.

2. **NumPy Integration**: Works seamlessly with NumPy arrays and functions.

3. **GPU Acceleration**: Can target NVIDIA CUDA GPUs for parallel computing.

4. **Automatic Optimization**: Applies various optimizations without requiring changes to your Python code.

## How Numba is Used in the `events.py` File

In the `events.py` file, Numba is used in several ways:

1. **@njit Decorator**: 
   ```python
   @njit(cache=True)
   def sample_from_cumulative_probs(values, cum_probs, uniforms):
   ```
   This decorator compiles the function to machine code. The `cache=True` argument allows Numba to cache the compiled function for faster subsequent calls.

2. **@jitclass Decorator**:
   ```python
   @jitclass(spec)
   class CumulativeProb(object):
   ```
   This decorator is used to compile a Python class, allowing for fast operations on its methods and attributes.

3. **Performance Benefits**: By using Numba, computationally intensive functions like `sample_from_cumulative_probs` and `event_samples_numba` can run much faster than standard Python code, especially when dealing with large arrays.

## Advantages of Using Numba

1. **Speed**: Can significantly speed up numerical computations.
2. **Ease of Use**: Requires minimal changes to existing Python code.
3. **NumPy Compatibility**: Works well with existing NumPy code.
4. **Selective Optimization**: Can be applied to specific functions that need performance boosts.

## Considerations

1. **First-Run Overhead**: There's a compilation overhead on the first run of a Numba-optimized function.
2. **Limited Python Subset**: Not all Python features are supported by Numba.
3. **Debugging**: Can make debugging more challenging as the code is compiled.
