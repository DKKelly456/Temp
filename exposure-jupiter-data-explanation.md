# Jupiter Data in JupterExposureMeasure

## Overview

The "Jupiter" in `JupterExposureMeasure` likely refers to Jupiter Intelligence, a company that provides climate risk analytics. While the code doesn't explicitly define Jupiter data, we can infer its nature from the class implementation.

## Characteristics of Jupiter Data

Based on the `JupterExposureMeasure` implementation, we can infer the following about Jupiter data:

1. **Hazard Types**: Jupiter data covers multiple hazard types, including:
   - Combined Inundation
   - Chronic Heat
   - Wind
   - Drought
   - Hail
   - Fire

2. **Data Format**: The data appears to be provided as either single parameters or event distributions, as evidenced by the handling of both `HazardParameterDataResponse` and `HazardEventDataResponse` in the `get_exposures` method.

3. **Specific Indicators**: Each hazard type has a specific indicator:
   - Combined Inundation: "flooded_fraction"
   - Chronic Heat: "days/above/35c"
   - Wind: "max_speed"
   - Drought: "months/spei3m/below/-2"
   - Hail: "days/above/5cm"
   - Fire: "fire_probability"

4. **Categorization**: The data allows for categorization into five levels of exposure (LOWEST, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, HIGHEST) based on predefined thresholds.

5. **Spatial Data**: The data is likely geospatial, as it's requested for specific latitude and longitude coordinates (inferred from the `Asset` parameter in `get_data_requests`).

6. **Temporal Aspects**: The data is scenario and year-specific, allowing for analysis of future climate conditions under different scenarios.

7. **Wind Data Specificity**: There's a special case for wind data, using a specific model:
   ```python
   hint=HazardDataHint(path="wind/jupiter/v1/max_1min_{scenario}_{year}")
   ```
   This suggests that Jupiter provides detailed wind data, possibly at 1-minute resolution.

## Potential Nature of Jupiter Data

Given these characteristics, Jupiter data likely consists of:

1. **Climate Model Outputs**: Processed results from climate models, focusing on specific hazards.
2. **Historical Data**: Possibly combined with historical observations for calibration.
3. **Probabilistic Projections**: Especially for event-based data, providing probability distributions of hazard intensities.
4. **High-Resolution Grids**: Geospatial data at a resolution fine enough for asset-level analysis.
5. **Multiple Scenarios**: Data for different climate change scenarios (e.g., RCP 8.5).
6. **Temporal Projections**: Projections for various future time periods.

## Usage in JupterExposureMeasure

The `JupterExposureMeasure` class uses this data to:

1. Request specific hazard information for given assets, scenarios, and years.
2. Interpret the received data values.
3. Categorize the exposure levels based on predefined thresholds.
4. Provide a standardized exposure assessment across different hazard types.

## Considerations

1. **Data Access**: The actual data retrieval is abstracted through the `HazardModel`, suggesting a modular approach to data sourcing.
2. **Customization**: The predefined categories and thresholds in `JupterExposureMeasure` are tailored to Jupiter's data ranges and meanings.
3. **Proprietary Nature**: As a commercial product, the exact methodologies and data processing techniques used by Jupiter may not be fully disclosed in the code.
