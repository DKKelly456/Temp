\section{Overview}

This module defines various asset classes used in a risk assessment or asset management system, with a particular focus on power generating assets. It includes enumerations for fuel types, cooling systems, and turbine types, as well as classes for different types of assets.

\section{Enumerations}

\subsection{\texttt{FuelKind} (Enum)}
Represents different types of fuel used in power plants, based on the Global Power Plant Database v1.3.0.

Values include: Biomass, Coal, Cogeneration, Gas, Geothermal, Hydro, Nuclear, Oil, Other, Petcoke, Solar, Storage, Waste, WaveAndTidal, Wind

\subsection{\texttt{CoolingKind} (Enum)}
Represents different cooling systems used in power plants.

Values:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Dry}: Affected by Air Temperature, Inundation
    \item \texttt{OnceThrough}: Affected by Drought, Inundation, Water Temperature, Water Stress
    \item \texttt{Recirculating}: Affected by Drought, Inundation, Water Temperature, Water Stress, Wet-Bulb Temperature
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texttt{TurbineKind} (Enum)}
Represents types of turbines used in power plants.

Values: Gas, Steam

\section{Classes}

\subsection{\texttt{Asset}}
Base class for all assets.

Attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{latitude} (float): Geographical latitude of the asset
    \item \texttt{longitude} (float): Geographical longitude of the asset
    \item \texttt{id} (Optional[str]): Unique identifier for the asset
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texttt{WindTurbine} (dataclass)}
Represents a wind turbine, inheriting from \texttt{Asset}.

Additional attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{capacity} (Optional[float]): Power generation capacity
    \item \texttt{hub\_height} (Optional[float]): Height of the turbine hub
    \item \texttt{cut\_in\_speed} (Optional[float]): Minimum wind speed for operation
    \item \texttt{cut\_out\_speed} (Optional[float]): Maximum wind speed for operation
    \item \texttt{fixed\_base} (Optional[bool]): Whether the turbine has a fixed base (default: True)
    \item \texttt{rotor\_diameter} (Optional[float]): Diameter of the rotor
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texttt{PowerGeneratingAsset}}
Represents a generic power generating asset, inheriting from \texttt{Asset}.

Additional attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{type} (Optional[str]): Type of the power generating asset
    \item \texttt{location} (Optional[str]): Location of the asset
    \item \texttt{capacity} (Optional[float]): Power generation capacity
    \item \texttt{primary\_fuel} (Optional[FuelKind]): Primary fuel used by the asset
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texttt{ThermalPowerGeneratingAsset}}
Represents a thermal power generating asset, inheriting from \texttt{PowerGeneratingAsset}.

Additional attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{turbine} (Optional[TurbineKind]): Type of turbine used
    \item \texttt{cooling} (Optional[CoolingKind]): Type of cooling system used
\end{itemize}

Methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{get\_inundation\_protection\_return\_period()}: Returns the design return period for inundation protection (250 years for most plants, 10,000 years for nuclear plants)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texttt{RealEstateAsset}}
Represents a real estate asset, inheriting from \texttt{Asset}.

Additional attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{location} (str): Location of the real estate
    \item \texttt{type} (str): Type of real estate
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texttt{ManufacturingAsset}}
Represents a manufacturing asset, inheriting from \texttt{Asset}.

Additional attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{location} (Optional[str]): Location of the manufacturing asset
    \item \texttt{type} (Optional[str]): Type of manufacturing asset
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texttt{IndustrialActivity}}
Represents an industrial activity, inheriting from \texttt{Asset}.

Additional attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{location} (Optional[str]): Location of the industrial activity
    \item \texttt{type} (str): Type of industrial activity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texttt{TestAsset}}
A simple test asset class, inheriting from \texttt{Asset} with no additional attributes or methods.

\section{Usage Notes}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \texttt{Asset} class serves as the base for all other asset types, providing common attributes like latitude, longitude, and ID.
    
    \item The \texttt{PowerGeneratingAsset} class uses a type string to determine the primary fuel. The type string can contain multiple archetypes separated by "/".
    
    \item The \texttt{ThermalPowerGeneratingAsset} class extends this concept, using additional archetypes in the type string to determine turbine and cooling types.
    
    \item The \texttt{get\_inundation\_protection\_return\_period()} method in \texttt{ThermalPowerGeneratingAsset} provides different protection levels for nuclear vs. non-nuclear plants.
    
    \item Various asset types (RealEstate, Manufacturing, IndustrialActivity) are provided for different use cases in the risk assessment or asset management system.
    
    \item The \texttt{TestAsset} class can be used for testing purposes or as a placeholder for future asset types.
\end{enumerate}
